# Unix 2

This is the folder for advanced concepts in Unix 2.
I listed what each of them do below.

### Commands

1. mkdir: Makes a new directory.

2. cp: Copies files into a new directory.

3. less: Views file contents one page at a time.

4. mv: Moves or renames files.

5. rm: Removes files or directories.

### Arguments

1. ```cp file2.txt file3.txt my_folder/``` An example of adding multiple 

    arguments to a command.

2. ```PS1="[\u@\h \W]$ "``` An example of adding an argument to an option.

### Kernels and Shells

1. echo $SHELL: Acceses the current shell.

2. ps -p $$: Displays the running shell process.

3. zsh: Switches to another shell. In this example zsh.

### Environment

1. ```alias ll='ls -l'``` Creates an alias for ls -l.

2. ```export PS1="[\u@\h:\w]$ "``` Customizes the terminal prompt.


This is a basic outline and explanation of the unix concepts I used.
