# Contributing plan
For this project, I am going to find a public repository and contribute to it. 

---

### When searching, I am looking for

- An active commit history.
- Proper folder structure.
- Community backing ( repository has many stars/forks).
- Contributing md file.
- Beginner problems/sectors to contribute to.

---

With this in mind I found three repositorys to choose from.

- [CyberScraper-2077](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077)
- [HackingTool](https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool)
- [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)
