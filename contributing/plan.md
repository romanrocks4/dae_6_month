# Contribution Plan

## Overview

This document outlines my structured plan to contribute to external open-source cybersecurity repositories. As a penetration tester, all my projects and contributions aim to improve security tooling, documentation, and usability for the broader infosec community.

## Selected Repositories

I have chosen three repositories to analyze for potential contributions:

1. **CyberScraper-2077** – [https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077)
2. **Hackingtool** – [https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool](https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool)
3. **PentestGPT** – [https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT](https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT)

After reviewing all three, I selected **CyberScraper-2077** as the repository I will actively contribute to for this phase.

## Contribution Choice

### **Chosen Repository:** CyberScraper-2077

### **Reason for Choosing:**

* The project is a security-focused web scraping tool aligned with my penetration testing and automation interests.
* The codebase lacks inline documentation, making it difficult for new contributors or security researchers to understand the flow.
* Adding comments increases readability, lowers onboarding time, and improves future maintainability.

### **Chosen Contribution Type:** Add detailed inline comments throughout the scrapers folder.

### **Why This Contribution Matters:**

* Enhances code clarity and understanding.
* Helps new contributors understand module functionality.
* Supports long-term maintainability and encourages more community involvement.
* Improves educational value for beginners studying scraping and automation.

## Contribution Steps

### **1. Fork the Repository**

* Navigate to CyberScraper-2077 on GitHub.
* Create a fork under my GitHub account to begin working safely.

### **2. Clone the Fork Locally**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<my-username>/CyberScraper-2077
cd CyberScraper-2077
```

### **3. Review the Code Structure**

* Identify all modules in scrapers lacking comments.
* Build an understanding of function flow, logic, and dependencies.
* Take notes on unclear code that may need refactoring in the future.

### **4. Add Inline Comments**

* Add descriptive comments explaining:

  * Function purposes
  * Key variables and logic blocks
  * Modules and data flows
  * Complex conditions or loops
* Ensure comments follow consistent style and remain concise.

### **5. Run and Test the Code**

* Ensure comments introduce no syntax issues.
* Verify that no functional changes were accidentally introduced.
* Confirm that scripts behave identically before and after commenting.

### **6. Commit with Proper Message**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added descriptive inline comments for improved readability and maintainability"
```

### **7. Push and Open a Pull Request**

```bash
git push origin main
```

* Open a PR to the original repository.
* Clearly describe the purpose of the contribution.
* Highlight examples of enhanced readability.

### **8. Respond to Reviewer Feedback**

* Make changes if requested.
* Keep communication professional and aligned with project goals.

## Future Possible Contributions

If the initial contribution is accepted, I may expand into the following areas for additional value:

### **For CyberScraper-2077:**

* Add modular error handling.
* Add user documentation or a more detailed README.
* Introduce optional logging or verbosity flags.

## Conclusion

This contribution plan ensures a clear, structured path to improving open-source infosec tooling while aligning with my penetration testing background. The focus on CyberScraper-2077 will meaningfully enhance clarity and usability for all future contributors.
