# Fix for CLI Pentest Tool API Key Issue

## Problem
The CLI pentest tool was failing to load the Gemini API key from the .env file, showing the error:
```
‚ùå Failed to generate summary: 400 API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by missing dependencies that were preventing the CLI tool modules from being imported correctly. Specifically, the `sqlmodel` package was missing, which caused import errors in the project modules.

## Solution
1. Installed the missing `sqlmodel` dependency:
   ```
   pip3 install sqlmodel
   ```

2. Verified that the API key loading functions were working correctly by:
   - Testing the API key format and length
   - Verifying that the .env file was being read correctly
   - Confirming that the API key was valid by testing with the Google Generative AI API

3. Updated the API key loading functions in both the AI module and reporting module to:
   - Provide better debugging information
   - Check multiple possible locations for the .env file
   - Handle errors more gracefully

## Verification
After installing the missing dependency, both the local and system-wide installations of the CLI tool are now working correctly:
- The API key is being loaded from the .env file
- The Google Generative AI API is being initialized successfully
- Summaries are being generated correctly

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
2. Add better error handling and logging to the API key loading functions
3. Consider adding a validation step to check if the API key is valid before using it
