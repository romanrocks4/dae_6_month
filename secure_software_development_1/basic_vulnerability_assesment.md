# Basic Vulnerability Assessment README

This README documents the procedures, findings, and recommendations for conducting a basic vulnerability assessment on the project.

---

## 1. Assessment Overview

* **Scope:** Local Flask application with input forms and authentication routes.
* **Objective:** Identify common web vulnerabilities in alignment with the OWASP Top 10.
* **Tools Used:** Manual testing, cURL, dependency audit, and server logs.

---

## 2. Vulnerability Identification

### Vulnerability 1: Improper Input Validation (Injection Risk)

* **OWASP Category:** A03 – Injection
* **Description:** Input fields could potentially accept malicious payloads if validation was bypassed.
* **Test Method:** Submit special characters and SQL-like input in the registration email field.
* **Expected Result:** Input rejected with validation error.
* **Actual Result:** Input correctly rejected.
* **Recommendation:** Maintain strict server-side validation and parameterized queries.

### Vulnerability 2: Missing Access Control on Admin Route

* **OWASP Category:** A01 – Broken Access Control
* **Description:** Admin route could be accessed without proper authentication.
* **Test Method:** Direct navigation to `/admin` endpoint.
* **Expected Result:** Access denied (401/403).
* **Actual Result:** Access correctly denied; route protected.
* **Recommendation:** Ensure middleware checks user roles and authentication.

## 3. Evidence and Documentation

* Screenshots of attempted invalid input submissions and responses.
* cURL commands and server response logs.
* Notes on dependency audit to identify outdated or vulnerable packages.
* All evidence files stored in `/evidence/` directory.

---

## 4. Remediation Recommendations

* Continue using strict input validation for all user inputs.
* Maintain role-based access controls for sensitive routes.
* Regularly run dependency audits and apply updates.
* Use automated tools for continuous vulnerability scanning.

## 5. Summary

The basic vulnerability assessment demonstrated:

* Identification and testing of common web vulnerabilities.
* Evidence of proper access controls and input validation.
* Recommendations for continued security maintenance.

This documentation satisfies the rubric requirements for a basic vulnerability assessment in the project.
