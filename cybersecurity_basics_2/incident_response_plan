# Incident Response Plan (IRP) — Incident Response Team

**Project:** Zero Trust Simulation — “Acme Finance”  
**Document Owner:** Incident Response Team Lead: `Roman Shubin`  
**Date:** `10/21/2025`  
**Environment:** Simulated / Documentation-only

---

## Purpose
This IRP provides a structured, repeatable 5-step incident response framework (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery) and documents forensic and evidence-handling procedures used in the simulated engagement.

---

## 1. Preparation
**Goals**
- Establish roles, tools, communications, and evidence storage before incidents occur.

**Team & Roles**
- Incident Lead — overall coordination, escalation
- Forensics Lead — evidence acquisition and analysis
- IT Lead — containment and remediation actions
- Communications Officer — internal/external notifications
- Legal/Privacy Advisor — compliance and disclosure guidance

**Tools**
- SIEM: Wazuh/Splunk (simulated)
- EDR/HIPS: Wazuh, OSSEC (simulated)
- Forensics: Autopsy, Volatility
- Network capture: tcpdump, Wireshark
- Evidence repository: Encrypted S3 bucket or encrypted filesystem

**Prepared Artifacts**
- Contact list with 24/7 escalation numbers
- Pre-approved isolation ACLs / scripts
- Evidence storage location and access control
- Chain-of-custody template (see Appendix A)

---

## 2. Identification
**Detection Sources**
- SIEM alerts (authentication anomalies, EDR alerts)
- User reports (phishing, suspicious email)
- Automated detection (IDS/IPS, anomalous network behavior)

**Example Identification Scenario (simulated)**  
- SIEM Alert ID: `ALERT-2025-SSH-001`  
- Trigger: >10 failed SSH logins for user `finance_admin` within 5 minutes from IP `203.0.113.45`  
- Initial actions: timestamp and capture relevant logs (`/var/log/auth.log`), note related EDR events.

**Documentation to Collect**
- Timestamped alert screenshot or export
- Relevant log excerpts (auth logs, application logs)
- Associated EDR/host telemetry IDs

---

## 3. Containment
**Containment Strategy**
- Short-term: quickly limit the impact (isolate host, block offending IPs, disable compromised accounts).
- Long-term: maintain business continuity while ensuring attacker cannot persist or move laterally.

**Containment Steps (simulated)**
1. Isolate host from critical networks with pre-approved ACL (`quarantine-acl-apply.sh`).
2. Block attacker IP(s) at perimeter and in host firewall (`iptables`/cloud SG).
3. Suspend affected accounts (mark as password reset required).
4. Preserve volatile data (memory image) if forensics required.

**Evidence Tasks During Containment**
- Create snapshots of host(s)
- Capture volatile memory if elevated activity detected
- Start tcpdump capturing relevant flows (limited capture window)

---

## 4. Eradication
**Goals**
- Remove malicious artifacts, close exploited vectors, and verify system integrity.

**Typical Actions**
- Remove malware files and malicious cron jobs
- Revoke and rotate compromised credentials and keys
- Apply security patches for exploited vulnerabilities
- Validate removal via EDR scans and host integrity checks

**Verification**
- Run host file integrity checks (e.g., `Tripwire`/Wazuh FIM)
- Validate database/application integrity (checksums, transaction logs)
- Confirm EDR shows no active malicious processes

---

## 5. Recovery
**Steps**
1. Restore affected systems from trusted backups or rebuild from hardened images.
2. Reintroduce host to production under monitoring.
3. Monitor for reoccurrence (72–90 day heightened monitoring window).
4. Complete post-incident testing and apply lessons learned.

**Recovery Evidence**
- Restore logs, backup checksums, validation reports
- Monitoring logs showing normal behavior following return to service

---

## Forensics Basics (Example: Volatility Memory Analysis)
**Acquisition**
- Snapshot or `dd` memory image to a controlled host:  
  `dd if=/dev/mem of=/evidence/mem_YYYYMMDD.raw bs=1M` (simulated acquisition only)

**Analysis Steps**
- List processes: `volatility -f mem.raw pslist`
- Extract network connections: `volatility -f mem.raw netscan`
- Dump suspicious process memory: `volatility -f mem.raw memdump -p <pid> -D ./dumps`

**Hashing & Integrity**
- Compute SHA256 immediately after acquisition:  
  `sha256sum mem_YYYYMMDD.raw > mem_YYYYMMDD.raw.sha256`

---

## Evidence Collection & Chain-of-Custody
**Required Evidence Types (minimum two)**
- Log file excerpt: `/var/log/auth.log` (SSH failure sequence)
- SIEM/EDR alert screenshot: `siem_alert_AL-2025-SSH-001.png`

**Manifest Template Example**
| Evidence ID | Filename | SHA256 | Collected By | Timestamp (UTC) | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| EVID-001 | auth.log.excerpt | `<sha256>` | `<Your Name>` | `2025-10-01T14:23Z` | SSH brute-force attempt logs |
| EVID-002 | siem_alert_AL-2025-SSH-001.png | `<sha256>` | `<Your Name>` | `2025-10-01T14:25Z` | SIEM alert screenshot |

**Chain-of-Custody Entry (fillable)**
- Evidence ID:  
- Collected by:  
- Date/Time (UTC):  
- Method (scp/rsync/local copy):  
- Destination storage path:  
- SHA256:  
- Notes / Redaction performed:

## Incident Triage & Prioritization (3 Example Incident Types)
1. **Malware on Host** — Severity: *Critical* — Impact: potential service outage / data corruption  
2. **SQL Injection Attempt** — Severity: *High* — Impact: data exposure or integrity compromise  
3. **Phishing / Credential Theft** — Severity: *Medium* — Impact: account takeover risk

Triage criteria include: impacted asset criticality, data sensitivity, exploitation evidence, and lateral movement capability.

---

## Post-Incident Analysis & Lessons Learned
**Post-Incident Summary (simulated)**
- Incident: SSH brute-force leading to credential compromise of a test account. Contained via isolation, rotation, and increased MFA enforcement.
- Outcome: No data exfiltrated in simulation; remediation applied.

**Lessons Learned**
1. Expand MFA coverage and reduce fallback recovery channels.  
2. Increase authentication log retention and implement automated anomaly detection for failed logins.  
3. Harden account lockout policies and integrate adaptive rate-limiting at perimeter.
