# Python 2

This is the main python folder for this repository. Here I will add the majority of my python code. 

### This File currently contains

    1. A rock paper scissors game that I created at the start of the semester. 
    This game is played entirely within the terminal and 
    can be played by downloading the file and opening it in a code editor. 
    
    If you would like to see the algorithm and 
    thought process you can go to the logic folder in the same repository or 
    click here.

### I am currently working on 

    1. A discord chat bot with AI capabilities. 
    I will be adding to this folder as I work on the bot.
