# Python 2

This is the main python folder for this repository. Here I will add the majority of my python code. 

### This File currently contains

    1. A rock paper scissors game that I created at the start of the semester. 
    This game is played entirely within the terminal and 
    can be played by downloading the file and opening it in a code editor. 
    
    If you would like to see the algorithm and 
    thought process you can go to the logic folder in the same repository or 
    click here.

### I am currently working on 

    1. A discord chat bot with AI capabilities. 

    I will be adding to this folder as I work on the bot.
     There are currently 0 files added. 

    For the three week python course I will be building an AI powered discord chatbot. 
    The bot will run on a discord server and be able to  respond to messages that the user sends.
    Its main purpose will be a personal assistant that can give reminders, make lists, and add events to a calendar. 
    To power the bot I will use discords application and bot interface. I will connect to it with their API. 
    For the AI capabilities, I will use LM studio and run a local LLM for the bot so I can use my own API key.
    The project will take two weeks of coding and troubleshooting with a designated schedule for each day and week.
    I have created an   algorithm, flowchart, and schedule to keep me on track and organized.
