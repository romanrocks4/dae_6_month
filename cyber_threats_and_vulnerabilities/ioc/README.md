# Threat Intelligence Project — Implement Threat Intelligence Principles

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Threat Intelligence Principles** by analyzing **two Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**. The project includes detection methods, threat explanation, and proper documentation with screenshots and exported data.

---

## Deliverables
By completing this project, I will:
- Understand what IoCs are and why they matter.
- Analyze IoCs using online tools and sandbox environments.
- Write sample detection rules (Sigma/YARA/Suricata) for IoCs.

## IoC Analysis

### IoC #1 — File Hash
**File Hash:** 310548ac49f4240b5071f76555ccdb4fea3f8605cfcdf4ed8f5fa8e3d077e138

**Tool Used:** VirusTotal

**Detection Method:**
- Example Sigma rule: `INSERT_RULE_PATH_HERE`
- Example YARA rule: `INSERT_RULE_PATH_HERE`

**Analysis:**
- Detection ratio: `INSERT_DETECTION_RATIO`
- Malware classification: `INSERT_CLASSIFICATION`
- File behavior observed: `INSERT_BEHAVIOR`

**Screenshot:**  
`INSERT_PATH_OR_EMBED_SCREENSHOT_HERE`

**Why this indicates a threat:**  
`EXPLAIN_IN_2-3_SENTENCES why this file hash is considered malicious.`

### IoC #2 — Domain/IP
**Domain/IP:** `INSERT_DOMAIN_OR_IP_HERE`

**Tools Used:** AbuseIPDB, WHOIS, Passive DNS, VirusTotal

**Analysis:**
- Reputation: `INSERT_REPUTATION_RESULTS`
- WHOIS info: `INSERT_WHOIS_INFO`
- Historical data / Passive DNS: `INSERT_DATA_HERE`

**Screenshot:**  
`INSERT_PATH_OR_EMBED_SCREENSHOT_HERE`

**Why this indicates a threat:**  
`EXPLAIN_IN_2-3_SENTENCES why this domain/IP is associated with malicious activity.`
