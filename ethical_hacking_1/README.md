#Ethical Hacking 1
---
For ethical hacking 1 I used a variety of tools and steps in the pentesting process. The tools I used are explained below

1. **Nmap**: Nmap is a network scanner designed to discover hosts and   services on a network. it is one of the most vital tools in pentesting.

2. **Nessus**: Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that looks for security flaws and weaknesses, and then creates a report based on the findings, along with possible remediation.

3. **Wireshark**: Wireshark is an open source tool that lets you capture and inspect the data packets traveling across a network in real time.

4. **Metasploit**: Metasploit is computer security project designed to find vulnerabilities and aid in penetration testing. Its most commonly used for executing exploitation code

5. **theHavester**: theHarvester is an open source OSINT tool designed to gather information about a target. Potential information includes, subdomains, e-mail addresses, and IP addresses.

All the tools explained above can be found in the "tools" folder.

To start, I used Nmap to perform a tcp scan on my network.

Then, I did a udp scan.

Finally, I ran a service scan.

With the ports scanned, I used Nessus
