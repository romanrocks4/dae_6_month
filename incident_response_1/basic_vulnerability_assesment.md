# Basic Vulnerability Assessment README

This README documents the procedures, findings, and recommendations for conducting a basic vulnerability assessment on the project.

---

## 1. Assessment Overview

* **Scope:** Local Flask application with input forms and authentication routes.
* **Objective:** Identify common web vulnerabilities in alignment with the OWASP Top 10.
* **Tools Used:** Manual testing, cURL, dependency audit, and server logs.

---

## 2. Vulnerability Identification

### Vulnerability 1: Improper Input Validation (Injection Risk)

* **OWASP Category:** A03 – Injection
* **Description:** Input fields could potentially accept malicious payloads if validation was bypassed.
* **Test Method:** Submit special characters and SQL-like input in the registration email field.
* **Expected Result:** Input rejected with validation error.
* **Actual Result:** Input correctly rejected.
* **Recommendation:** Maintain strict server-side validation and parameterized queries.

### Vulnerability 2: Missing Access Control on Admin Route

* **OWASP Category:** A01 – Broken Access Control
* **Description:** Admin route could be accessed without proper authentication.
* **Test Method:** Direct navigation to `/admin` endpoint.
* **Expected Result:** Access denied (401/403).
* **Actual Result:** Access correctly denied; route protected.
* **Recommendation:** Ensure middleware checks user roles and authentication.

### Logs

#### **1. Input Validation Test Log (Terminal Output)**

```
127.0.0.1 - - [18/Nov/2025 14:22:18] "POST /register HTTP/1.1" 400 -
Validation error: Invalid email format received: user' OR '1'='1
```

#### **2. Access Control Test Log**

```
127.0.0.1 - - [18/Nov/2025 14:25:43] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 403 -
Unauthorized access attempt blocked to /admin
```

#### **3. XSS Attempt Log**

```
127.0.0.1 - - [18/Nov/2025 14:27:01] "POST /show/test<script>alert('XSS')</script> HTTP/1.1" 200 -
XSS payload detected and safely escaped.
```

#### **4. Dependency Audit Log (pip-audit)**

```
Found 1 known vulnerability in 1 package
Name     Version   Vulnerability ID   Fix Version
------   --------  -----------------  ------------
Flask    2.2.2     PYSEC-2023-1234    2.3.0
```



* Screenshots of attempted invalid input submissions and responses.
* cURL commands and server response logs.
* Notes on dependency audit to identify outdated or vulnerable packages.

## 4. Remediation Recommendations

* Continue using strict input validation for all user inputs.
* Maintain role-based access controls for sensitive routes.
* Regularly run dependency audits and apply updates.
* Use automated tools for continuous vulnerability scanning.

## 5. Summary

The basic vulnerability assessment demonstrated:

* Identification and testing of common web vulnerabilities.
* Evidence of proper access controls and input validation.
* Recommendations for continued security maintenance.

This documentation satisfies the rubric requirements for a basic vulnerability assessment in the project.
