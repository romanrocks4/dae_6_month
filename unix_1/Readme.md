# Unix 1

This is my unix 1 folder that contains a .txt file showing my unix abilities. This file is a text copy of my terminal and contains no interactiveness.

### The commands I used are explained below

1. pwd: Print working directory shows a full path of the directory you are in.

2. ls: Lists the files and directories in the current folder.

3. cat: Displays the contents of the file.

4. touch: Creates a new empty file.

5. An option modifies the behavior of a command such as "ls -l". It usually has a dash - or two dashes --

6. An argument is when you apply the command to a particular file or folder.

7. Text editors such as Vim are used to create and edit files in the terminal.

8. Permissions determine who can read, write, and execute a file. You can view them with "ls -l"

9. chmod: Edits the permissions of a file.

10. &&: lets you combine two commands and execute them simultaneously.
